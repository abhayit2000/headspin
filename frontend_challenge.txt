Frontend Challenge

Project: Create an interactive UI that allows tagging objects, and
creating selections based on those tags.

See demo.mov for a very crude UI demonstrating these concepts. The UI
depicted in the video represents a bare minimum acceptable solution;
all the components are there, but the layout is hard to understand,
and the interactions are jerky and hard to follow. Please go above and
beyond what you see in the demo video!

If you get stuck, get in touch! We’re all humans here :-)


Download Sessions
-----------------

We are working with "download sessions" -- testing data downloads on
mobile networks all over the world.

A download session has a size, a duration (time), and list of tags:

{
  size: 200,
  time: 9,
  tags: [...]
}

A tag is a `name=value` pair:

{
  name: 'city',
  value: 'Jakarta'
}

We should be able to add tags to and remove tags from download
sessions.


Selections
----------

We are interested in setting up "Selections" that allow us to monitor,
in real-time, statistics of sessions with a certain tag set.

A Selection is a list of tags:

[
  { name: 'city', value: 'Jakarta' },
  { name: 'carrier', value: 'Vodafone' }
]

The selection above means:

Every session S such that
  S.tags contains a tag T with
    T.name == 'city' and T.value == 'Jakarta'
  OR
  S.tags contains a tag T with
    T.name == 'carrier' and T.value == 'Vodafone'

So a Selection represents a subset of the list of download sessions -- every
session whose tags match the selection criteria.

A selection computes aggregate statistics for the sessions whose tags
match its criteria. Basic averages are fine (average bytes, average
size, average speed).


Interaction
-----------

The required interactions are demonstrated in demo.mov. Here they
are in words:

Be able to delete a tag from a session.

Be able to add a tag to a session.

When a tag is added to a session, UI immediately updates the
statistics for any selections that include the session based on the
new tag.

When a tag is deleted from a session, UI immediately updates the
statistics for any selections that included the session based on that
tag.

When the mouse hovers a selection, its corresponding sessions get
visually highlighted in some way.

Be able to delete a selection.

Be able to create a new selection. When the new selection is created,
it immediately updates with statistics, if there are any objects that
pass its filter.


Deliverable
-----------

A static web app in a zip file would be great. You can use the
included input_data.js. This is just raw data, feel free to massage it
however is needed. We tend to build web apps with angular.js, but feel free
to use your favorite javascript framework to complete this challenge.


Rubric
------
We’re looking for code organization and reasoning as well as UI layout
and ease of interaction.


Bonus Points
------------

1. Selections as defined above take the form of a logical disjunction (a=x or b=y).
   Extend selections to be disjunctions of conjunctions:
   (a=x and b=y) or (a=z and c=p and d=m) or ...

   1a. Duplicate tag names allowed in conjunctions
       (a=x and a=y) or (a=m and a=n)

       This involves allowing tagging a session with multiple tags
       that share a name.

2. Read-only tags. Some sessions might be tagged with Read-only, or
   "system tags" that cannot be deleted or modified, but can still be
   selected for like a regular tag.
